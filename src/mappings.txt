Polygon classification

regular/irregular

convex
concave
    simple (no self-intersections)
    almost simple (cross overs that could be converted to simple)
    complex (holes or some other? unremovable overlap)


cyclic polygon -- has a circumcircle (through all the points)
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribed_circle

monotone polygon -- WRT to a line, if every perpendicular to the line intersects polygon at most once
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_polygon

   see also "polar analogue" star shaped  ...

some of the mappings logical operators do
   union
     convex  -> concave
     concave -> simple

   difference
     convex -> complex

   intersection
     convex -> convex
     simple -> simple
     complex -> complex
