Polygon classification

regular/irregular

convex
concave
    simple (no self-intersections)
    almost simple (cross overs that could be converted to simple)
    complex (holes or some other? unremovable overlap)




some of the mappings logical operators do
   union
     convex  -> concave
     concave -> simple

   difference
     convex -> complex

   intersection
     convex -> convex
     simple -> simple
     complex -> complex
